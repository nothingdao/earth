# Tokenomics Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the economic mechanics governing character NFT minting, EARTH token distribution, and the dual-economy system. The design follows a gold standard approach with automated distribution mechanisms and market-driven pricing.

## Character NFT Minting

**Mint Cost:** 2 SOL per character NFT

### SOL Distribution Breakdown

Upon successful character NFT mint, the 2 SOL payment is automatically distributed as follows:

- **1.0 SOL** → EARTH token purchase (creates token supply)
- **0.75 SOL** → Reserve wallet (development and operations)
- **0.25 SOL** → System store inventory backing fund
- **Transaction fees** → Network costs

## EARTH Token Mechanics

### Token Creation

All EARTH tokens are created exclusively through SOL purchases. No EARTH tokens can be minted without corresponding SOL backing.

### Distribution from Minting

The 1.0 SOL EARTH token purchase is allocated:

- **0.5 SOL equivalent** → Liquidity pool pairing (paired with 0.5 SOL)
- **0.5 SOL equivalent** → Universal Basic Income (UBI) distribution

### Universal Basic Income (UBI)

Each character NFT mint triggers an automatic UBI distribution equal to 0.5 SOL worth of EARTH tokens (25% of mint cost). This distribution is credited to the player's in-game balance through the treasury bridge system.

## Dual Economy Structure

The game operates two distinct but interconnected economies:

### System Economy (SOL-Backed)

- **System stores** selling region-specific items (tools, basic gear, infrastructure items)
- **Prices adjusted weekly** based on market conditions and player trading activity
- **All system items backed** by the store inventory backing fund
- **Regional variation** in pricing based on local supply/demand patterns

### Player Economy (Market-Driven)

- **Player-crafted items** sold exclusively player-to-player for SOL
- **Pricing determined entirely by players** through marketplace dynamics
- **No system buyback** of player-created items (maintains backing integrity)
- **True free market** with natural price discovery

## In-Game Economy

### EARTH Acquisition

Players acquire EARTH tokens through:

- UBI distribution upon character NFT minting
- Selling scavenged items to system stores
- Selling crafted items created from mined or scavenged materials to system stores

### EARTH Utilization

Players spend EARTH tokens on:

- System store inventory purchases
- Character customization and visual upgrades
- Tools and basic equipment

### SOL Economy

Players use SOL for:

- Purchasing player-crafted items in marketplace
- Trading rare or specialized equipment
- Premium transactions outside the EARTH economy

### Economic Flow

EARTH spent in system stores returns to the treasury, creating a circular economy. The store inventory backing fund ensures system stores maintain adequate reserves for player transactions. Player-to-player SOL transactions remain entirely within the player economy.

## Price Discovery and Market Dynamics

### System Store Pricing

- **Initial pricing** based on backing fund calculations
- **Weekly automated adjustments** responding to:
  - Average player market prices for comparable items
  - System item sales velocity
  - Regional economic activity
- **Regional variation** reflecting local supply/demand conditions

### Player Market Pricing

- **Entirely market-driven** with no system intervention
- **Natural price discovery** through supply/demand dynamics
- **Regional arbitrage opportunities** for traders
- **Quality-based pricing** determined by player preferences

## Economic Principles

### Self-Regulating System

- Minimal automated interventions (weekly pricing updates only)
- Market forces determine player economy pricing
- No burn mechanics for standard transactions
- Regional economies develop organically

### Dual Economy Benefits

- **System economy** provides stability and baseline availability
- **Player economy** creates competitive pricing and innovation
- **Clear economic boundaries** maintain backing integrity
- **Player value creation** through crafting and trading

### Sustainability Model

The system is designed to be self-sustaining through:

- Circular EARTH flow in system economy
- SOL-backed player economy growth
- Regional economic development
- Natural market equilibrium mechanisms

### Expansion and Growth

New economic opportunities are created through:

- Introduction of new regions with unique resources
- Seasonal resource availability changes
- New crafting recipes and item categories
- Infrastructure development enabling new trading patterns
